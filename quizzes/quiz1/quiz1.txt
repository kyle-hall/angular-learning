
1. Create an angular application that binds a name in a text input to another tag.

2. Add a list of objects to the application. There should be at least 5 objects, each with a name and description property.

3. Display all of these objects, both name and description.

4. Display all of these objects, this time with only the names all uppercase.

5. Display all of these objects, this time with only the description all uppercase.

6. Add a text input that lets the user filter the objects based on the input text.

Bonus: Can you make the search function search only for a name or for a description matching the input text?
